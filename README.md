# Personal Website

This is a personal website project, designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `style.css`: CSS styles for the website.
- `script.js`: JavaScript for any interactive elements (currently minimal).
- `assets/`: Directory for static assets like images and videos.
  - `assets/images/`: For photo(s).
  - `assets/videos/`: For video files (if hosting directly).

## Design

The website follows a simple, clean design with a dark theme, based on an initial sketch. It includes:
- A header with the website title.
- An 'About' section with a biography and a photo.
- Three content sections for 'Projects', 'Chess', and 'Calisthenics', each intended to feature an embedded video.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the site locally.
3. To deploy on GitHub Pages, ensure your repository is configured correctly in the GitHub settings.

## Customization

- Replace placeholder text in `index.html` with your actual bio, project details, etc.
- Add your photo to `assets/images/` (e.g., `placeholder_photo.jpg`) or update the `src` attribute in `index.html`.
- Embed your videos in the respective sections in `index.html`. You might use YouTube embeds or host video files in `assets/videos/`.
- Modify `style.css` to change the appearance.
